			<p>London was the world's largest city from about 1831 to 1925. London's overcrowded conditions led to cholera epidemics,
			 claiming 14,000 lives in 1848, and 6,000 in 1866. Rising traffic congestion led to the creation of the world's first
			local urban rail network. The Metropolitan Board of Works oversaw infrastructure expansion. It was replaced in 1889 by the London
			County Council, London's first elected city-wide administration. The Blitz and other bombing by the German Luftwaffe during World
			War II killed over 30,000 Londoners and destroyed large tracts of housing and other buildings across London. Immediately after
			the war, the 1948 Summer Olympics were held at the original Wembley Stadium, at a time when the city had barely recovered from
			the war.</p>

			<p>In 1951 the Festival of Britain was held on the South Bank. The Great Smog of 1952 led to the Clean Air Act 1956, which ended the
			"pea-souper" fogs for which London had been notorious. From the 1950s onwards, London became home to a large number of immigrants,
			largely from Commonwealth countries such as Jamaica, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, making London one of the most diverse cities
			in Europe.</p>

			<p>Starting in the mid-1960s, London became a centre for the worldwide youth culture, exemplified by the Swinging London subculture
			associated with Carnaby Street. The role of trendsetter was revived during the punk era. In 1965 London's political boundaries were
			expanded to take into account the growth of the urban area and a new Greater London Council was created. During The Troubles
			in Northern Ireland, London was subjected to bombing attacks by the Provisional IRA. Racial inequality was highlighted by the 1981
			Brixton riot. Greater London's population declined steadily in the decades after World War II, from an estimated peak of 8.6 million
			in 1939 to around 6.8 million in the 1980s. The principal ports for London moved downstream to Felixstowe and Tilbury, with the
			London Docklands area becoming a focus for regeneration as the Canary Wharf development. This was borne out of London's ever-increasing
			role as a major international financial centre during the 1980s.</p>

			<p>The Thames Barrier was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the North Sea. The Greater London Council
			was abolished in 1986, which left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration. In 2000, London-wide
			government was restored, with the creation of the Greater London Authority. To celebrate the start of the 21st century, the Millennium Dome,
			London Eye and Millennium Bridge were constructed. On 7 July 2005, three London Underground trains and a double-decker bus were bombed in
			a series of terrorist attacks.</p>
