			<p> During the Tudor period the Reformation produced a gradual shift to Protestantism, with much of London passing from church
			to private ownership. Mercantilism grew and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established,
			with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and
			abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.</p>

			<p> In the 16th century William Shakespeare and his contemporaries lived in London at a time of hostility to the development of
			the theatre. By the end of the Tudor period in 1603, London was still very compact. There was an assassination attempt on James
			I in Westminster, through the Gunpowder Plot on 5 November 1605. London was plagued by disease in the early 17th century,
			 culminating in the Great Plague of 1665 - 1666, which killed up to 100,000 people, or a fifth of the population.</p>

			<p>The Great Fire of London broke out in 1666 in Pudding Lane in the city and quickly swept through the wooden buildings.
			Rebuilding took over ten years and was supervised by Robert Hooke as Surveyor of London. In 1708 Christopher
			Wren's masterpiece, St Paul's Cathedral was completed. During the Georgian era new districts such as Mayfair were formed in
			the west; and new bridges over the Thames encouraged development in South London. In the east, the Port of London expanded
			downstream.</p>

			<p>In 1762 George III acquired Buckingham House and it was enlarged over the next 75 years. During the 18th century, London was
			dogged by crime and the Bow Street Runners were established in 1750 as a professional police force. In total, more than
			200 offences were punishable by death, and women and children were hanged for petty theft. Over 74 per cent of children
			born in London died before they were five. The coffeehouse became a popular place to debate ideas, with growing literacy
			and the development of the printing press making news widely available; and Fleet Street became the centre of the British press.</p>
