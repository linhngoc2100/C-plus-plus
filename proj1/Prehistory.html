			<p>Although there is evidence of scattered Brythonic settlements in the area, the first major settlement was founded by
			the Romans in 43 AD. This lasted for just seventeen years and around 61, the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed
			it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned incarnation of the city prospered and superseded Colchester as
			the capital of the Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height during the 2nd century, Roman London had a population
			of around 60,000. By the 7th century, the Anglo-Saxons had created a new settlement called Lundenwic over a mile (2 km)
			upstream from the old Roman city, around what is now Covent Garden.</p>
			
			<p>It is likely that there was a harbour at the mouth of the River Fleet for fishing and trading, and this trading grew, 
			until the city was overcome by the Vikings and forced to move east, back to the location of the Roman Londinium, in order
			to use its walls for protection. Viking attacks continued to increase, until 886 when Alfred the Great recaptured London
			and made peace with the Danish leader, Guthrum. The original Saxon city of Lundenwic became Ealdwic ("old city"), a name
			surviving to the present day as Aldwych, which is in the modern City of Westminster.</p>
			
			<p>Two recent discoveries indicate that London could be much older than previously thought. In 1999, the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were
			found on the foreshore north of Vauxhall Bridge. This bridge either crossed the Thames, or went to a (lost) island in the river.
			Dendrology dated the timbers to 1500BC.</p>
			
			<p>In 2010, the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to 4500BC, were found on the Thames foreshore, South of Vauxhall Bridge. 
			The function of the mesolithic structure is not known, but it covers at least 50m x 10m, and numerous 30 cm posts are visible at low tides.
			Both structures are on South Bank, at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the River Thames, and 4 km upstream from
			the Roman City of London. The effort required to construct these structures implies trade, stability, and a community size of several
			hundred people at least.</p>
