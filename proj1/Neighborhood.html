		<p>London's vast urban area is often described using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel.
		These are either informal designations, reflect the names of villages that have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative
		units such as parishes or former boroughs.</p>

		<p>Such names have remained in use through tradition, each referring to a local area with its own distinctive character, but without current
		official boundaries. Since 1965 Greater London has been divided into 32 London boroughs in addition to the ancient City of London.
		The City of London is the main financial district and Canary Wharf has recently developed into a new financial and commercial hub, in
		the Docklands to the east.</p>

		<p>The West End is London's main entertainment and shopping district, attracting tourists. West London includes expensive residential
		areas where properties can sell for tens of millions of pounds. The average price for properties in Kensington and Chelsea is 894,000 GBP
		with similar average outlay in most of central London.</p>

		<p>The East End is the area closest to the original Port of London, known for its high immigrant population, as well as for being one of the
		poorest	areas in London. The surrounding East London area saw much of London's early industrial development; now, brownfield sites
		throughout the area are being redeveloped as part of the Thames Gateway including the London Riverside and Lower Lea Valley, which is
		being developed into the Olympic Park for the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics.</p>
