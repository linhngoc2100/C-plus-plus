		<p>London's buildings are too diverse to be characterised by any particular architectural style, and have been built over
		a long period of time. Many grand houses and public buildings, such as the National Gallery, are constructed from Portland
		stone. Some areas of the city, particularly those just west of the centre, are characterised by white stucco or whitewashed
		buildings. Few structures pre-date the Great Fire of 1666, except for a few trace Roman remains, the Tower of London and a
		few scattered Tudor survivors in the City. One notable building that remains from the Tudor period is Hampton Court Palace,
		which is England's oldest surviviving Tudor palace, built by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey circa 1515. Wren's late 17th century
		churches and the financial institutions of the 18th and 19th centuries such as the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England,
		to the early 20th century Old Bailey and the 1960s Barbican Estate form part of the varied architectural heritage.</p>
		
		<p>The disused, but soon to be rejuvenated, 1939 Battersea Power Station by the river in the southwest is a local landmark,
		while some railway termini are excellent examples of Victorian architecture, most notably St. Pancras and Paddington.
		The density of London varies, with high employment density in the central area, high residential densities in inner London
		and lower densities in the suburbs.</p>
		
		<p>The Monument in the City of London provides views of the surrounding area while commemorating the Great Fire of London, which
		originated nearby. Marble Arch and Wellington Arch, at the north and south ends of Park Lane respectively, have royal connections,
		as do the Albert Memorial and Royal Albert Hall in Kensington. Nelson's Column is a nationally recognised monument in Trafalgar
		Square, one of the focal points of the city centre.</p>
		
		<p>Buckingham Palace is the official residence of the British monarch</p>
		<p>High-rise development is restricted at certain sites if it would obstruct protected views of St Paul's Cathedral. Nevertheless,
		there are plans for more skyscrapers in central London (see Tall buildings in London), including the 72-storey Shard London Bridge
		which is currently under construction. Development temporarily stalled as a result of the recent financial crisis, but is reported
		to be recovering. Older buildings are mainly brick built, most commonly the yellow London stock brick or a warm orange-red
		variety, often decorated with carvings and white plaster mouldings.</p>
		
		<p>In the dense areas, most of the concentration is achieved with medium- and high-rise buildings. London's skyscrapers such as
		30 St Mary Axe, Tower 42, the Broadgate Tower and One Canada Square are usually found in the two financial districts, the City
		of London and Canary Wharf. Other notable modern buildings include City Hall in Southwark with its distinctive oval shape, and
		the British Library in Somers Town/Kings Cross. What was formerly the Millennium Dome, located by the Thames to the east of Canary
		Wharf, is now used as an entertainment venue called The O2 Arena.</p>
		
		<p>London is home to many museums, galleries, and other institutions, many of which are free of admission charges and are major
		tourist attractions as well as playing a research role. The first of these to be established was the British Museum in Bloomsbury,
		in 1753. Originally containing antiquities, natural history specimens and the national library, the museum now has 7 million artefacts
		from around the globe. In 1824 the National Gallery was founded to house the British national collection of Western paintings; this
		now occupies a prominent position in Trafalgar Square. In the latter half of the nineteenth century the locale of South Kensington
		was developed as "Albertopolis", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are located there: the Victoria and
		Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The national gallery of British art is at
		Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also
		became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power
		Station.</p>
